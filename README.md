Conway's game of life
=====================

This is an implementation of the famous

in Python. It's a result of Sunday afternoon boredom.

* Write a parser for .cells files from
  [here](http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/lexicon/) to try out
  interesting configurations

* Implement in other languages (whenever bored again!)
